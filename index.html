    <h1>This is the landing page for SYSbot, the First Ever Discord Bot coded in SYSlang!</h1>
    <h2>This site contains Docs & The online status of the bot, plus a few extras.</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>So, what is SYSbot?</h3>
    <p>Good Question. <br> SYSbot is Yet Another Multipurpose Discord Bot, but unique compared to others, because it is coded in SYSlang. <br>
        And not only does this make SYSbot unique, but also the fact that it is the first ever bot coded in said language, that it has a separate Open Source version to private version (thx V1RU5 for removing the 9 shard limit).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another thing we (The Developers and Maintainers) love about SYSbot is it's main idea/purpose. <br>
        You see, SYSbot was a challenge, an experiment if you like, to see how hard it is to make an interactive 3rd party API for a service such as Discord. <br>
            The result? well... The result was an American Hacker (V1RU5), Canadian Programmer (Chawi Mi), British Programmer (TallerThanShort), a certain Alkazar, and an entire online community joining together, making an incredible relationship, and crashing the internet.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>So, why this website?</h3>
    <p>This entire website was made in honor of Chawi Mi. <br>
        He had planned on releasing this kind of a website for the bot before he passed away unexpectedly. <br>
            Chawi was the main creator/curator of the bot in his time, and had very clear ideas of where he wanted the bot to go. <br>
                One of those ideas, was to add a database system to the bot, but that requires us making an entire new class and api, so... we'll see. <br>
                    For now, we are still working on updates to the bot, like the bots embeds, and more recently,  this site (hey, added a toggleable dark theme!).</p>
